title: A beginner's journey into Improv (Part 1)
subtitle: The best journeys are those out of your comfort zone

## Introduction
I very recently joined a Level 1 Workshop on Improv. I am about 8 classes in, and have a showcase coming up soon. Suffice it to say that I'm incredibly nervous and excited, which is probably one of the best mixture of emotions ever. It's not been easy learning it, there is definitely a lot I've had to unlearn.

I just thought I'd share how the journey's been thus far, in case others are looking to learn about Level 1 and what its like.

## Why Improv
I have always wanted to try out Improv, for many reasons-
- I am a huge comedy nerd
I love SNL. Most if not all of the comedic genuises I look up to joined and spoke very highly of Improv. Most seem to start off of it and have credited it with a lot of their success
- Improvisation has always been fun for me
I love improvising. It's the reason why I always compose new music when I sit with my guitar. Even when I was in a band, we would much rather jam and perform our own music rather than covers.
- My comedy style has always tended towards Improv
I am terrible at jokes; I tend to forget stories easily and I always muck up my delivery. I would suck at Stand Up. But I've always felt I've been my funniest when on the spot, when there's context around and I can find the funny in it. So Improv is a way to find my sense of comedy, understand it, and nurture it.

These reasons coupled with the fact that I wanted to try something new clinched the deal. I was gonna learn Improv one way or another.

## Challenges
Improv for me has been pretty difficult for me to get better at. Mostly because there's not as much to learn, as there is to unlearn. We all arrive with a lot of social conditioning that has been inflicted on us as part of everyday life. And letting go of these rules is hard.
### 1) There is no I in Improv
Improv is similar to the Zen philosophy of life. In order to be a good improviser, you must forget yourself. You must shed your Ego and your desires. You must start thinking of yourself of the scene, the characters, the relationships.

This concept was very hard to wrap my head around. I strongly wanted to be funny and considered a hilarious on-the-spot comedian. So I stopped listening to how the scene was progressing and started thinking of how I wanted to scene to go. And invariably, since it was out of my hands, I used to bomb. This is what they call in Improv "not listening".

I knew it as it was happening, but I wasn't able to help it. I simply wasn't able to think of the scene without thinking of myself or how I could make it funny. I had to keep reminding myself to let it go everytime I consciously realized I was doing it.

### 2) You must learn to handle the pressure
The pressure is omnipresent in Improv. You will feel pressure when you have to

- Come up with something on the spot
- React in moments while multiple improvisers depend on you
- Step out of your comfort zone
- Remember many patterns - Names, Relationships, Objectives, Environments
- Listen
- Perform on stage
- Be funny (an internal pressure for beginner students who haven't managed to let go of their Ego)

This is probably the hardest of all the challenges and one that I'm always working toward getting over. I am still figuring it out, but experience and practice helps in understanding how to overcome it. However, the one thing that seems most important in handling the pressure is Team Work.

### 3) Team work is everything
This is probably the most fundamental concept in Improv. Without a team, you cannot do Improv. This ties in to the first point about there being no self. Once you get this right, pressure becomes simple to handle, because when you work as a team, the pressure gets shared among its induividuals. And in order to work with a group, you must learn to communicate.

### 4) Communication takes many forms
Communication is two way. In order for something to be conveyed effectively, both the speaker and the listener must work together. You cannot just say something and walk away. You must make sure it is conveyed and understood. So listening is very important in Improv, and in life.

However, the thing that baffled me the most is that there are so many forms of communication. When you're listening properly, you understand so much about another person. You understand when he's in discomfort, when he's uneasy, when he's excited and rearing to go. When you learn to effectively communicate, you can wing it in every situation with the other person. You can do what I like to call "harmonize" effectively.

When I understand communication and all of it's types further in detail, maybe I'll jot them down, explain how to look for them in a different article.

### 5) The only time that matters is now
There are many things going on in an Improv scene. In order to be able to react to them, you must have razor sharp focus. Again, I think the only way to understand and incorporate this is by conditioning yourself to it. Which means experiencing and doing a lot of Improv.

## Conclusion
I think my journey with Improv is a life long one. I will be detailing the process on this Blog. So do subscribe and stay tuned for more of the same. Keep learning and improvising.
